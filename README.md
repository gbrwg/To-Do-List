# CPSC 210 PROJECT

## Project Proposal 
In my application that I will create, I want the application to be able to keep track of homework and their upcoming 
assignments. It will allow students to keep track of assignments and tasks and they can stay organized. I'm interested in making a planner 
application because I like to be able to keep track of what tasks I have done and what I need to do next so I can plan
accordingly. It helps me stay **organized** and finish my assignments on time.
